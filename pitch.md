## problem:
- 6 / 10 Americans do not have the savings to cover a $500-$1000 emergency expense
- U.S. survey of age group of 18 to 34 years old - 47 percent did freelance work in 2017
  - gig economy is here and growing quickly
- most budgeting solutions work on monthly planning, fixed salary, fixed expenses (things that don't exist for many!)

## solution:
- daily cash flow predictions using monte carlo simulations
  - allow people to see cash flows on a daily basis
  - forsee cash crunches, augment saving capabilities
- use aggregated financial data suggest gig economy tax deductions / breaks
  - "I'm not a businessman. I'm a business, man." - Jay-Z
